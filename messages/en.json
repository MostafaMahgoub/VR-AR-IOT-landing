      "challenge": "The Challenge:",
      "challengeContent": "In the cement and building materials industry, 28-day compressive strength tests are the fundamental standard for determining cement quality and usability. However, these traditional tests take a long time of up to four weeks, leading to delays in production and quality control decisions, negatively affecting project implementation speed and operational efficiency.",
      "solution": "The Solution:",
      "solutionContent": "By leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, an advanced model is developed capable of instant prediction of expected compressive strength after 28 days. This model relies on analyzing chemical data of cement components immediately after leaving production lines. Instead of waiting for weeks, results can be obtained in just a few minutes.",
